### virtually any alternative to `virtual`

This repository is inspired by Jonathan Gopel's ([@jalapenothong](https://twitter.com/jalapenothong)) talk 
[Using Modern C++ to Eliminate Virtual Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTNJXVmuRRA) from CppCon 2022.
The main idea evolves around the usage of C++20 concepts to narrow down the contract of generic types. 
This repository implements a solution for the practice task Jonathan presents at [48:38](https://youtu.be/gTNJXVmuRRA?t=2618),
however, it differs from the presented solution in multiple ways.
